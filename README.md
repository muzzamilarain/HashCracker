Hash Cracker is a Python-based tool that cracks cryptographic hash values using wordlists `rockyou.txt`. It auto-detects the hashing algorithm and attempts to recover the original password using brute-force techniques.

> Built for cybersecurity students, CTF players, and ethical hackers who want real skills and real tools.
